#### <a name="chapter1part1"></a>Chapter 1 - Part 1: What is Spring Framework?

Java Spring Framework (Spring Framework) is a popular, open source, enterprise-level framework for creating standalone, production-grade applications that run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Spring Framework is so popular because offers a dependency injection feature that lets objects define their own dependencies that the Spring container later injects into them. This enables developers to create modular applications consisting of loosely coupled components that are ideal for microservices and distributed network applications.

Spring Framework also offers built-in support for typical tasks that an application needs to perform, such as data binding, type conversion, validation, exception handling, resource and event management, internationalization, and more. It integrates with various Java EE technologies such as RMI (Remote Method Invocation), AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol), Java Web Services, and others. In sum, Spring Framework provides developers with all the tools and features the need to create loosely coupled, cross-platform Java EE applications that run in any environment.

#### <a name="chapter1part2"></a>Chapter 1 - Part 2: What is Spring Boot?

Java Spring Boot (Spring Boot) is an open source Java-based framework used to create a microservices with Spring Framework. It is developed by Pivotal Team and is used to build stand-alone and production ready spring applications.

It is a project built on top of the Spring framework that provides an efficient way to set up and run applications.

As capable and comprehensive as Spring Framework is, it still requires significant time and knowledge to configure, set up, and deploy Spring applications. Spring Boot mitigates this effort with three important capabilities.

Spring Boot consists of the Spring Framework and Embedded Servers. Because it uses convention over configuration software design, it does not require XML configuration.
